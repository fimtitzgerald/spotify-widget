### Spotify Widget for macOS

Early stages WIP of a simple command line widget to give feedback on currently playing information from Spotify. 

##### TO-DO
* Pretty up the interface
* Pretty up the text. 
* Maybe add player controls? 
* Add some cool ascii art so its really haxxor
* Dunno - anything else I can think of that gives me an excuse to try out something new in Go.
